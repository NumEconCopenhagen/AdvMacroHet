                   income, so that the smoothness of consumption cannot

  abstract =      {This paper presents a model in which price setting
                   firms decide what to pay attention to, subject to a
                   constraint on information flow. When idiosyncratic
                   conditions are more variable or more important than
                   aggregate conditions, firms pay more attention to
                   idiosyncratic conditions than to aggregate
                   conditions. When we calibrate the model to match the
                   large average absolute size of price changes observed
                   in micro data, prices react fast and by large amounts
                   to idiosyncratic shocks, but only slowly and by small
                   amounts to nominal shocks. Nominal shocks have strong
                   and persistent real effects. (JEL D21, D83, E31,

                   according to which temporary real effects of purely
                   nominal disturbances result from imperfect
                   information, but departs from the assumptions of
                   Lucas (1973) in two crucial respects. Due to
                   monopolistically competitive pricing, higher-order
                   expectations are crucial for aggregate inflation
                   dynamics, as argued by Phelps (1983). And
                   decisionmakers' subjective perceptions of current
                   conditions are assumed to be of imperfect precision,
                   owing to finite information processing capacity, as
                   argued by Sims (2001). The model can explain highly
                   persistent real effects of a monetary disturbance,
                   and a delayed effect on inflation, as found in VAR
                   studies.},

                   little or no liquid wealth (e.g. cash, checking, and
                   saving accounts), despite owning sizable amounts of
                   illiquid assets (i.e., assets that carry a
                   transaction cost, such as housing, large durables, or
                   retirement accounts). This portfolio configuration
                   implies that these households have large marginal
                   propensities to consume out of small income changes
                   â€“a key determinant of the macroeconomic
                   effects of fiscal policy. The wealthy hand-to-mouth,
                   therefore, behave in many respects like households
                   with little or no net worth, yet they escape standard
                   definitions (and empirical measurements) of
                   hand-to-mouth agents based on net worth. We use
                   survey data on household portfolios for the U.S.,
                   Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy,
                   and Spain to document the share of such households
                   across countries, their demographic characteristics,
                   the composition of their balance sheet, and the
                   persistence of hand-to-mouth status over the life
                   cycle. Finally, we discuss the implications of this
                   group of consumers for macroeconomic modelling and
                   policy analysis.},

  abstract =      {This paper uses the information contained in the
                   joint dynamics of individuals' labor earnings and
                   consumption-choice decisions to quantify both the
                   amount of income risk that individuals face and the
                   extent to which they have access to informal
                   insurance against this risk. We accomplish this task
                   by using indirect inference to estimate a structural
                   consumption–savings model, in which individuals
                   both learn about the nature of their income process
                   and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In
                   this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial
                   insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences
                   in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with
                   which individuals know their own income growth rates
                   when they begin their working lives, (iv) the
                   persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the
                   tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the
                   amount of measurement error in the data. In
                   implementing indirect inference, we find that an
                   auxiliary model that approximates the true structural
                   equations of the model (which are not estimable)
                   works very well, with negligible small sample bias.
                   The main substantive findings are that income shocks
                   are moderately persistent, systematic differences in
                   income growth rates are large, individuals have
                   substantial amounts of information about their income
                   growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are
                   smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these
                   findings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime
                   income risk that individuals perceive is
                   substantially smaller than what is typically assumed
                   in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete
                   markets.},

                   advanced economies. We find that after controlling

                   degree of autocorrelation, with a stickiness
                   parameter of about 0.7 on average across countries.
                   The sticky consumption growth model outperforms the
                   random walk model of Hall (1978) and typically fits
                   the data better than the popular Mankiw (1989) model,

                   policy for household consumption in a Heterogeneous
                   Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. The model yields
                   empirically realistic distributions of household
                   wealth and marginal propensities to consume because
                   of two key features: multiple assets with different
                   degrees of liquidity and an idiosyncratic income
                   process with leptokurtic income changes. In this
                   environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected
                   cut in interest rates, which operate through a
                   general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far
                   outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal
                   substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to
                   small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New
                   Keynesian (RANK) economies, where intertemporal
                   substitution drives virtually all of the transmission
                   from interest rates to consumption.},
